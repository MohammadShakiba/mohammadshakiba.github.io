        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
            I was born and raised in Kerman, Iran, 1995. The journey of my scientific career is full of curiosities 
			and I try to explain a small part of it chronologically. <br><br>
			<strong>Undergraduate Time - September 2013-February 2018</strong><br><br>
			I've received my <strong>B.S. in Civil Engineering</strong> from 
			Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK) in February 2018.
			During this time in SBUK, I worked on a variety of experimental and computational projects one of which was 
			studying the effect of activated pozzolan with nano silica on natural pozzolan paste properties (<a target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267923602.pdf">link</a>) in 
			the group of <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hzOaEsUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Reza Rahgozar</a>. <br> 
			I was also very interested in fundamental sciences like 
			mathematics and physics but there was no advanced course on that in Civil Engineering program. So, I started self-studying topics like 
			(numerical) linear algebra, elementary neural networks, ordinary and partial differential equations plus different numerical methods 
			for solving them such as finite difference, finite and boundary element, and spectral methods. MATLAB was the major programming language 
			I used during my undergrad and the "<a target="_blank" href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719598">Spectral Methods in MATLAB</a>"
			by LN Trefethen was my favorite book. With MATLAB, I did the following:<br><br>
			<strong>&bull;</strong> Designing an elementary autonomeous car that could adjust its acceleration based on 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://datahub.transportation.gov/stories/s/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Open-Data/i5zb-xe34/">NGSIM data</a> using 
			a feed-forward neural networks. This data was 
			denoised with wavelets and regenerated using Newtonian equations of motion.<br>
			<strong>&bull;</strong> Automatizing steel connection design usin MATLAB outputing the design information into an Excel file in Farsi (Persian).<br>
			<br>
			See the following videos on how I used MATLAB to design some parts of the steel structures.<br>

			<strong>Master of Science - September 2018-February 2021</strong><br><br>
			I started my <strong>M.S. in Nanomaterials Engineering</strong> in the same university under the supervision of 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OZKpH5wAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Gholam Reza Khayati</a>, 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ffw3dYAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ahmad Irannejad</a>, and 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eNhF1zoAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Shahriar Sharafi</a>. 
			This program was held in the Material Science and Engineering department and 
			was a big shift in my scientific career as it was a completely different major from Civil Engineering and had few overlaps with the courses
			I passed as an undergrad. During this time, I self-studied many of the quantum mechanical and quantum chemical concepts and started working 
			with different quantum chemistry codes such as Gaussian 09, Quantum Espresso, Siesta, and CP2K. I previosuly did not have any experience working
			with Linux environment and since I was the first person working on quantum chemical topics in our department, I had to start from a very 
			zero point such as installing different codes and packages (even compilers) with different architectures on the university cluster but 
			I could handle these hard steps at that point. It took me 36 days to install CP2K :)
			(there was no ChatGPT at that time) but it finally worked and I got a good skill in installation of different software packages on Linux! <br>
			Inspired by some works in <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.7b04729">Nano Letters</a> and 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04623-9">Nature Communication</a>, 
			I got familiared with <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct400641n">PYXAID</a> and decided to 
			add excited states dynamics calculations to my thesis.<br>
			
			In 2020, I started working remotely with 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ntSw8_cAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Alexey Akimov</a>'s group, 
			and started working on interfacing CP2K, Gaussian, and DFTB+ with 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Quantum-Dynamics-Hub/libra-code">Libra code</a> for studying the 
			excited states dynamics in nanomaterials. During this time, which I was still a graduate student in SBUK, we published two papers in 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01009">JCTC</a> and 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03799">JPCL</a> 
			performing NA-MD calculations for quantum dots and perovskite materials in the TD-DFT basis. My role was installation of CP2K on
			UB CCR cluster and the development of a parallelized grid-based approach for overlap integration of molecular orbitals at different time step 
			(using Gaussian cube files) and extraction of the CP2K outputs for generating the energies, time-overlaps, and nonadiabatic couplings 
			in both single-particle and TD-DFT excitation bases.<br>

				<source src="videos/video7.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video><br><br>
			
			Later in 2021, I started working on performing overlap integration in Gaussian type orbital (GTO) basis using 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/evaleev/libint">Libint2 code</a> for a parallel and more efficient integral calculations. 
			We integrated this into the Libra code
			and were able to perform NA-MD for very large systems such as silicon quantum dots with more than 1400 atoms and 
			carbon nitride monolayers with 5600 atoms using extended tight-binding approach. These works were published in 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.2c00297">JCTC</a> and 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c00211">JPCC</a> and

			<strong>Ph.D. - August 2022-Present</strong><br><br>

			
			In Fall 2022, I attended at the University at Buffalo as a Ph.D. student in Chemistry. Since my first semester I was appointed as 
			a Research Assistant. Even though the advanced Chemistry courses were hard and I had no prior strong knowledge in them, 
			I could pass the first two semester with a GPA of 3.89/4.0. My works were also selected as the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/chemistry/graduate/research-highlight.host.html/content/shared/arts-sciences/chemistry/graduate/research-highlights/november-2022--mohammad-shakiba.detail.html">graduate research highlights</a> of the 
			Chemistry department. During the last 2 and a half year at UB, I've pulished five first-author and two 
			second-author papers and won the John Rys scholarship issued by the department of Chemistry.<br>
			
			In my second year, I started working on adopting machine-learning techniques in NA-MD simulations and introduced a simple yet novel approach 
			in which one could map the material's properties obtained from one level of theoy to another, effectively bypassing the SCF cycle. 
			With this approach we can predict the KS Fock matrix at a higher level of theory from the KS Fock matrix from a lower level of theory 
			e.g. mapping the non-SCF-PBE KS Fock matrix (1st iteration of SCF cycle) to a B3LYP or HSE06 one (final iteration of SCF cycle). 
			It showed almost perfect accuracy for electronic structure prediction of
			nanoscale systems even when training the model with a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) using few percentage of the data. We performed NA-MD in
			the ML-generated molecular orbitals basis and it showed perfect match with the reference calculations.
			I provided an easy-to-use interface for that in the Libra code 
			(see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra/tree/master/6_dynamics/2_nbra_workflows/16_ml_hamiltonian_mapping">this tutorial</a>).<br>
			
			This appraoch was published in <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00008">JCTC</a>. I presented this approach in the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/MolSSI_workshop2024/_episodes/01-day1">MolSSI workshop</a> on ML in 
			quantum and nonadiabatic dynamics on August 2024. It was also presented at 
			teh ACS 2024 Fall meeting at Denver and won the best poster presentation in the 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://phys-acs.org/fall-2024-acs-phys-poster-awardees/">Physical Chemistry division</a>.<br><br>
						
						
			
			Since summer 2021, I have served as helper (software installation and support), instructor, and co-organizer of different workshops held at UB: <br>
